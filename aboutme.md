        		<h1>More About Me </h1> 
			<p> Currently, I am a freshman at UF! I hope to be a software programmer, and I am also interested in graphics. I have a great passion for math and science, and have placed in several county-wide competitions. On the side, I play cello and experiment with the audio tracks. I want to use 			my skills to bring a new brand of creativity to computer science.
